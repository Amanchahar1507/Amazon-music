    - Enable Authentication in your Firebase project and set up the sign-in methods you want to use (e.g., Email/Password).
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Firebase configuration:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    ```

4. **Setup RapidAPI**

    - Sign up on RapidAPI and subscribe to the API you want to use.
    - Add your RapidAPI key to the `.env` file:

    ```env
    REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-rapidapi-key
    REACT_APP_RAPIDAPI_HOST=your-rapidapi-host
    ```

5. **Run the application**

    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the application in your default browser.
